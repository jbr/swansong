/*!
# ðŸ¦¢ A graceful shutdown

## How this crate works

Each [`Swansong`] represents a functional unit of behavior that needs to coordinate termination. The
primary type [`Swansong`] provides the control interface.

To allow Swansong to interrupt/cancel/seal various types, use
[`Swansong::interrupt`]. [`Interrupt<T>`] has custom implementations of
[`Future`][std::future::Future], [`Stream`][futures_core::Stream],
[`AsyncRead`][futures_io::AsyncRead], [`AsyncWrite`][futures_io::AsyncWrite],
[`AsyncBufRead`][futures_io::AsyncBufRead], and [`Iterator`]. See further documentation for the
behaviors for each of these types at [`Interrupt`].

Each of the trait implementations will behave normally with a small overhead to check shutdown state
until shutdown has been initiated with [`Swansong::shut_down`]. When shutdown has been initiated,
any type inside of an associated Interrupt will be interrupted/canceled/sealed at an appropriate
time.

Swansong graceful shutdown is considered in progress while there are outstanding [`Guard`]s. All
guards must be dropped for shutdown to be considered complete. Guards can be created in three ways:

* [`Swansong::guard`] returns a standalone [`Guard`] that can be moved into a closure or future,
  stored in a struct, or otherwise retained temporarily during a block of code that should not be
  abruptly stopped. For example, a http server might move a [`Guard`] into a closure or async task
  that handle an individual request.
* [`Swansong::guarded`] returns a [`Guarded`] wrapper type provides transparent implementations of
  various traits like [`Future`][std::future::Future] and [`Stream`][futures_core::Stream], as well
  as [`Deref`][std::ops::Deref]ing to the wrapped type. This is identical to moving a [`Guard`] into the wrapped
  type, but sometimes it's easier to compose the guard around a named future than to move the guard
  into the future.
* [`Interrupt::guarded`] allows an Interrupt wrapper to also act as a guard.


## Async Example
```rust
# use async_global_executor as executor;
# use async_io::Timer;
# use std::{future::pending, time::Duration};
# use swansong::Swansong;
# futures_lite::future::block_on(async {
let swansong = Swansong::new();
executor::spawn(swansong.interrupt(pending::<()>()).guarded()).detach();
executor::spawn(swansong.guarded(Timer::after(Duration::from_secs(1)))).detach();
swansong.shut_down().await;
# });
```

## Sync example

```rust
# use std::{iter, thread, time::Duration};
# use swansong::Swansong;
let swansong = Swansong::new();

thread::spawn({
   let guard = swansong.guard();
   move || {
       let _guard = guard;
       thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
    }
});

thread::spawn({
    let swansong = swansong.clone();
    move || {
        for n in swansong.interrupt(iter::repeat_with(|| fastrand::u8(..)))
        {
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
            println!("{n}");
        }
    }
});

thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));

swansong.shut_down().block();
```
